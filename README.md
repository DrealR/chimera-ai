The pattern that keeps a system alive is the same one that keeps it aligned.

---

Start with `seed/` — one document, one idea.
Then `core/` — the principles at work.
Then `deep/` — where it gets specific.

---

```
seed/   the system is alive
core/   compute data and alignment, listening,
        serving the user, when to stop,
        the constellation, trust
deep/   the cancer of intelligence, the band,
        the body, alignment is not control,
        the breath of a system, open vs closed
```
